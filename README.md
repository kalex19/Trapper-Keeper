## Trapper-Keeper

Trapper Keeper is an application that allows users to keep track of their to-dos. Users can add or delete entire notes while also being able to add, edit, or delete individual items on a note. All notes and their to-dos are stored on a local back-end server using Node.js and Express.

## Project Goals:

* Implement React, Router, and Redux.
* Build a back-end server using Node.js/Express to store and save data.
* Create a well constructed UI.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.
